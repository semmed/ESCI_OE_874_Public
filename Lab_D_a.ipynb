    "For the directions it is helpful to represent the transducer arrays by unit vectors. Unit vectors have the unique property that the elements are the direction cosines with respect to the axis. We could proof this formally, but \n",
    "we will illustrate this at the hand of an example: the vector (1,1) has an angle of $1/4 \\pi$ radians and a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ Thus if we normalize the vector we end up with a vector $\\left(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{2}\\right)$ which has norm $1$. Similarly the $\\cos(1/4 \\pi) = \\sqrt{2}$. \n",

    "Thus it is very convenient to represent direction using unit vectors, the elements are direct measures of the angle that the vector makes with the coordinate axes. i.e. the first element represents the cosine of the angle of the vector with the first coordinate axis, the 2nd with the 2nd axis, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will chose some directions of convenience - ideally the transmit transducer is aligned to the X-axis of a vessel thus a logical vector to represent its orientation is (1,0,0), ( the angle with the x-axis is zero, thus the first element is cos(0) = 1, the angle with the y- and z-axes is 90 degrees cos(90) = 0 thus our vector is (1, 0, 0)\n",

In the figure above you can see that this sector data is followed by a table of beam specific data.

To clarifu it may be that beams 1,2,4 and, 5 were processed successfully, but beam 3 failed. The data for beam 3 is then not included in the table.

    "\n",
    "If a single location value is to be used, the average of the transmitter position at transmit and receiver position at the average received TWTT can reasonably be used, as we did in Lab A. Strictly though, over the reception cycle, the receiver does propagate forward. But at typical vessel speeds (~4m/s) the distance traveled, compared to the one way sound speed (750 m/s) is a very small fraction (0.5%) which is smaller than the beam footprint. For example, the projected beam width of a 0.5$^{\\circ}$ beam is 0.87% of Z (strictly slant range). Both these numbers are small compared to IHO Special Order horizontal accuracy requirements of 2m in 40m of water which corresponds to only 5% of Z.\n",

    "**Note** that this excludes the physical separation of the transmitter and receiver acoustic centers (normally at least ½ the physical array length). If bottom detection is attempted in the acoustic near field, that separation may be significantly larger than the forward propagation of the sonar over the ping cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lab A we cannot take a simple average, the beam steering is applied at the specific transmit and receive times, so we will create a virtual transducer with the transmit element located and oriented at `t_tx` and the receive element located and oriented at `t_rx`. Thus we need to have a vector that describes the distance traveled between those two epochs. We will use the vector `geo_pos_diff` for that purpose.\n",

However we have all the information needed to construct the virtual array. We know the orientation of the tx array at transmit and the rx array at reception. We also know how the vessel moved in the intervening epoch. If we assume that the transmit transducer is aligned to the x-axis  then we need to determine where the receive transducer is relative to the transmit transducer. We do have the vector `ref_pos_diff` which tells us how far and in what direction the vessel traveled (along the ground). Thus if we want to base a new reference frame based on the orientation of the transducer we need to rotate the difference vector of the rp locations by the negative amount of the heading at transmit.\n",
