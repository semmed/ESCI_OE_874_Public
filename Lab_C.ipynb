We could try to label the beams, but that would lead to many labels in the plot, making it even harder to read.\n",

The data in the matrix `TLa` are given in a polar coordinate system, each beam originates in the same point, namely the transducer. The range is the distance from the transducer; thus, it is possible to map the data to a polar reference frame and represent data by using a color to represent its value in each point. \n",

For all the depression angles and ranges contained in our definition of the swath we may then simply look up what the associated value (in this case absorption) is.\n",

    "In this step we will be transposing a vector that we extract from a matrix. In `numpy`\n",

    "transposition is to swap the dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to transpose a vector it needs to be two-dimensional! This can be very confusing until\n",

    "so if you are used to working with them this will be a big adjustment!\n",

    "\n",
    "    A = np.asarray(range(12)).reshape((3,4))\n",
